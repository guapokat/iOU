# iOU
An iOU app/toy written in Swift for couples during the holiday...aka you forgot to get a gift and your a Swift developer lol!
You need to:
<br>
-write in your own wishes where the example texts are.
<br>
-change the phone number in the message builder.
<br>
<br>
It DOES NOT have constraints in the auto layout, it is set up for 8plus size screen. You will need to add constraints for it to look proper on smaller/bigger screens. Also, no landscape support.

Good Luck!
